# Cookie-Jar
CS50 Week 6
Suppose that you’d like to implement a cookie jar in which to store cookies. In a file called jar.py, implement a class called Jar with these methods: __init__ should initialize a cookie jar with the given capacity, which represents the maximum number of cookies that can fit in the cookie jar. If capacity is not a non-negative int, though, __init__ should instead raise a ValueError (via raise ValueError). __str__ should return a str with 🍪, whereis the number of cookies in the cookie jar. For instance, if there are 3 cookies in the cookie jar, then str should return "🍪🍪🍪" deposit should add n cookies to the cookie jar. If adding that many would exceed the cookie jar’s capacity, though, deposit should instead raise a ValueError. withdraw should remove n cookies from the cookie jar. Nom nom nom. If there aren’t that many cookies in the cookie jar, though, withdraw should instead raise a ValueError. capacity should return the cookie jar’s capacity. size should return the number of cookies actually in the cookie jar.
